# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose of the Project

>The purpose of this project was to Map earthquakes within the last seven days as reported on the US geological site and create multiple layers to show those earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates of the world. There are also 3 base layer maps created to create different backgrounds to display the data. The layers that can be turned on or off include the tectonic plates, earthquakes around the world within the last 7 days and the earthquakes that were higher than a 4.5 in magnitude. The markers are color coded and scaled in proportion to the earthquakes magnitude. There are also popups included at each marker to display the earthquake magnitude and location.arthquake overlay.
